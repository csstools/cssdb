- Renamed: GitHub repository from `css-db` to `cssdb`, now aligning with npm

- Updated: Documentation.

Notes: The old feature IDs were problematic because they attempted to follow
specification section IDs, but some specifications weren‚Äôt aren‚Äôt always
covered by a single section, and many sections were inconsistently named.
Because there was no pattern one could predict for any of the headings, a new
system was created; to **name** the feature and provide **context**. This meant
a feature ID like `css-cascade-all-shorthand` became `all-property`, and
`css-fonts-propdef-font-variant` became `font-variant-property`, etc. This
greatly simplified all of the feature IDs and allowed for more predictive
naming moving forward.
